# Koolhaus Inteview question.

This was an interview question that I had with Koolhaus Games, a mobile game company based in Vancouver, BC, Canada. 
The problem was to create rectangles in a 2D plane and verify whether or not a point is inside the rectangle. 
The implementation is in a single file, with unit tests to verify correctness. 
The point of this exercise was to test my unerstanding of the object oriented paradigm and how I structure classes, etc.
